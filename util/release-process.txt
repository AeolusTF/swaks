This file is used to document the formal release process.  Populate
the next time I do a real release.  Needed because I apparently forgot
to manually update the "Change Summary" section of RELEASE/README.

# Do these commands on g3.(could be done from mb, but paths are set up for g3):

# Choose a release
export RELEASE=20180225.0

# run the actual script:
/home/jetmore/Documents/svn/swaks-trunk/util/gen-release.pl $RELEASE
