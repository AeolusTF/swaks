INSTALL
------------------------------
swaks is designed to be a self contained script.  It should run on any system
That has perl installed, although its capabilites may be limited by which
modules are or are not installed.

To get a snapshot of what swaks can and cannot do on a given system, run:

	swaks --support

swaks will evaluate the installed perl modules and inform you of any
missing functionality, and how to get that functionality.  Example output:

	=== AUTH CRAM-MD5 supported
	=== AUTH CRAM-SHA1 supported
	*** AUTH DIGEST-MD5 not available: requires Authen::DigestMD5
	*** AUTH NTLM not available: requires Authen::NTLM
	=== Basic AUTH supported
	=== Date Manipulation supported
	=== High Resolution Timing supported
	=== Local Hostname Detection supported
	=== MX Routing supported
	=== Pipe Transport supported
	=== Socket Transport supported
	=== TLS supported
