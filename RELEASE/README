INSTALL
------------------------------
Swaks is designed to be a self contained script.  It should run on any system
that has Perl installed, although its capabilites may be limited by which
modules are installed.

To get a view of what Swaks can and cannot do on a given system, run:

    swaks --support

Swaks will evaluate the installed perl modules and inform you of any
missing functionality, and how to get that functionality.  Example output:

    === AUTH CRAM-MD5 supported
    === AUTH CRAM-SHA1 supported
    *** AUTH DIGEST-MD5 not available: requires Authen::SASL
    *** AUTH NTLM not available: requires Authen::NTLM
    === Basic AUTH supported
    === Date Manipulation supported
    === High Resolution Timing supported
    === Local Hostname Detection supported
    === MX Routing supported
    === Pipe Transport supported
    === Socket Transport supported
    === TLS supported
