INSTALL
------------------------------
Swaks is designed to be a self contained script.  It should run on any system
that has Perl installed, although its capabilites may be limited by which
modules are installed.

To get a view of what swaks can and cannot do on a given system, run:

    swaks --support

swaks will evaluate the installed perl modules and inform you of any
missing functionality, and how to get that functionality.  Example output:

    === AUTH CRAM-MD5 supported
    === AUTH CRAM-SHA1 supported
    *** AUTH DIGEST-MD5 not available: requires Authen::SASL
    *** AUTH NTLM not available: requires Authen::NTLM
    === Basic AUTH supported
    === Date Manipulation supported
    === High Resolution Timing supported
    === Local Hostname Detection supported
    === MX Routing supported
    === Pipe Transport supported
    === Socket Transport supported
    === TLS supported

Change Summary
------------------------------
v20130209.0
  New Features:
    * Support for the XCLIENT SMTP extension
      (see http://www.postfix.org/XCLIENT_README.html)
    * Added --no-send-hints, --no-receive-hints, and --no-info-hints
      output control options
    * The TLS subsystem got a major facelift, including
      * Added --tls-cert and --tls-key options to specify the certificate
        Swaks will use when negotiationg TLS (debian bug 497654)
      * Added more error checking and logging around protocol negotiation
      * Added tlsv1_1 and tlsv1_2 as "known" protocol versions
      * Added --tls-protocol option
      * Added --tls-cipher option
      * Added --tls-verify option
      * Added --tls-ca-path option
  Notable Changes
    * The TLS information lines have changed some:
      * Changed "w/" to "with" and "peer subject DN" to "peer DN"
      * Changed the TLS cipher line from just NAME to VERSION:NAME:BITS
      * Added new line stating the DN of local cert or that none is being used
      * If the negotiated protocol version is unknown, print raw version number
    * Changes to --dump output
      * Added --tls-get-peer-cert setting
      * Added locally-available TLS/SSL protocol versions
    * Swaks no longer attempts to send QUIT down a connection when TLS
      negotiation fails.  This may cause issues with the use of --tls-optional
  Notable Bugs Fixed
    * Previous release did not properly "cancel" SASL session when server
      did not behave properly (reported by Erwan Legrand)
    * Swaks would send QUIT twice in specific cases involving mail rejections,
      the --quit-after option, and --pipeline
    * Swaks would die silently during errors in the SSL protocol negotiation
      (-tlsc -p 25 would cause it)
    * Swaks could fail to handle the end of a TLS session over a pipe transport
      when the server has closed the connection but Swaks is expecting to read
      more data
