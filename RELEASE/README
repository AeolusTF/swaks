INSTALL
------------------------------
swaks is designed to be a self contained script.  It should run on any system
That has perl installed, although its capabilites may be limited by which
modules are or are not installed.

To get a snapshot of what swaks can and cannot do on a given system, run:

    swaks --support

swaks will evaluate the installed perl modules and inform you of any
missing functionality, and how to get that functionality.  Example output:

    === AUTH CRAM-MD5 supported
    === AUTH CRAM-SHA1 supported
    *** AUTH DIGEST-MD5 not available: requires Authen::SASL
    *** AUTH NTLM not available: requires Authen::NTLM
    === Basic AUTH supported
    === Date Manipulation supported
    === High Resolution Timing supported
    === Local Hostname Detection supported
    === MX Routing supported
    === Pipe Transport supported
    === Socket Transport supported
    === TLS supported

Change Summary
------------------------------
v20111230.0
  New Features:
    * Added --output-file family of options to capture some or all output
      without requiring shell redirection
    * Added --protect-password option to protect "sensitive" user input
      (currently only auth passwords)
    * Added --auth-hide-password to replace recoverable passwords in SMTP
      session output with a dummy string
    * Added --auth-extra to have a single interface to pass non-standard
      authentication options into swaks.  Currently used by NTLM and
      DIGEST-MD5.
    * Added --show-raw-text option to provide more details of exact data
      being sent on the wire
  Notable Changes
    * SMTP Data token parsing has been changed from single-character (%F) to
      multi-character (%FROM_ADDRESS%) to reduce chance of collisions with
      message text, especially non-ascii language encoding.  See
      --use-old-data-tokens to recover old tokens while transitioning.
      (issue reported by Peter Baranyi)
    * Specifying the NTLM/MSN/SPA DOMAIN by appending "%DOMAIN" to the
      username is no longer supported.  See the new --auth-extra command.
    * The DIGEST-MD5 authentication no longer uses the (buggy)
      Authen::DigestMD5 module.  The Authen::SASL module is now used.
  Notable Bugs Fixed
    * Previous release broke ability to use --header to set custom headers
      (first reported by David Favor)
    * Previous release would not allow a file to be used to provide the
      message data if the file name contained the character "n".
      (first reported by dietrich.rebmann@******)
    * swaks has never properly handled creating date strings for timezones
      that are not on an even hour boundary.
      (report from, and patch provided by, Peter Samuelson)
    * The documented behavior of the "no-" prefix on swaks' options did not
      work when --OPTION and --no-OPTION were given in the same context.
    * The DIGEST-MD5 auth type was not completely implemented.  Worked
      extensively with Erwan Legrand to get as complete and useful an
      implementation as possible.
    * Previous release contained a regression in which TLS responses sent in
      multiple packets were not processed correctly.
      (reported by Peter J. Holzer)
